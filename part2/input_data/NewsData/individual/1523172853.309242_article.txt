Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund.Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position.By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods.
